# Introduction 
This project is an hybird automation testing framework built from scratch using Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, and Maven. It is designed to provide a structured and scalable approach to automated testing for web applications.

The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) to enhance maintainability and reusability. It integrates TestNG for test execution and reporting, Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Maven for dependency management and build automation.
